Here you will find a collection of experiments and case studies showcasing my work as an ML-oriented embedded engineer with a focus on data analysis and various machine learning techniques.

Throughout this repository, I explore the application of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as dimension reduction techniques and anomaly detection. I evaluate and play around with different models to understand their effectiveness and efficiency in various scenarios. The repository also contains practical examples of tuning model parameters, comparing the results of different approaches, and testing the effectiveness of algorithms on specific datasets.

I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that can learn from data to make better decisions. My work in this field is driven by a desire to create innovative solutions that are efficient, robust, and scalable. I believe that the intersection of machine learning and embedded systems has the potential to revolutionize many industries, and I am excited to be at the forefront of this cutting-edge field.

Overall, this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the application of different machine learning techniques to real-world data analysis problems. I hope that you find it insightful and informative, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions that you may have.
